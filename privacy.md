   - The extension retrieves user profile data from the following external URL:
     - `https://amirshnll.github.io/random-user-generator/data/data.json`
   - This data is used exclusively to display random user profiles within the extension's interface and is not stored or shared.

2. **Access Web-Accessible Resources**:
   - The extension may access web-accessible resources such as avatars, flags, or other static assets hosted externally.
